# Front-end for Sms Challenge.

Based on this great boilerplate: https://github.com/rtivital/react-pages-boilerplate.

Production build is now hosted at Gitub pages at https://oltur.github.io/sms-frontend/#/.

Uses https://***.appspot.com/sms search as a backend.

## npm scripts
* `npm start` – starts development server with webpack-dev-server
* `npm test` – runs tape with babel-register
* `npm run build` – builds project to production (Note that the result bundle is not suitable for hosting on Github Pages, use `npm run deploy` to build and deploy to Github Pages)
* `npm run deploy` – builds and deploys project to Github pages
* `npm run lint` – lints both JavaScript (with `npm run lint:js`) and Sass files (with `npm run lint:scss`)
* `npm run storybook` – starts storybook server on port 9001
